I am an engineering student at the University of Alberta and am currently completing my first year of studies. I've always had a strong interest in mathematics and physics, so engineering seemed like a natural career for me to pursue. I have been programming as a hobby for a while, in both web development and systems programming capacities. I have also been playing the piano since I was four years old, I have performed with the OSYO, and I have acted in multiple musicals. Also, a few years ago I managed to earn a Shodan (first-degree black belt) in Meibukan Gōjū-ryū Karate-do. All of this, along with a plethora of volunteer jobs over the years, has taught me the value in hard work and perseverance and has set me up for a successful career in engineering.
